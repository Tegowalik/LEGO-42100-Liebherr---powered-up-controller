# LEGO-42100-Liebherr---powered-up-controller

This powered up program makes it possible to control a LEGO 42100 Liebherr R 9800 Excavator by using the hand controller of the LEGO City trains. Two controller (https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/remote-control-88010) are required for the program.

How the controller works is shown in this TODO link video. The main idea is also shown in the picture below.

# Use the program yourself

Unfortunately the powered up app does not support importing and exporting of self written programs. Anyway there are two options that you too can use the program for your Liebherr.

## First option: Copy the program file into the powered up folder

## Second option: Reprogram

This will take you definetly longer than the first option - but in doing so, you may understand how the program works and how you can adapt it to your personal requirements.

## Actually use the program

It is really important to connect the two technic smart hubs and two controller to the app in the correct order as shown below!
